# BookingBoardroom

Constraints / Notes:
●	No part of a meeting may fall outside office hours.
●	Meetings may not overlap.
●	The system shall store the previously-submitted bookings. Storing in memory is ok. So the new bookings shall not overlap with “old” ones.
●	Bookings must be processed in the chronological order in which they were submitted.
Не реализованы
●	The booking submission system only allows one submission at a time, so submission times are guaranteed to be unique.
●	The ordering of booking submissions in the supplied input is not guaranteed. 
●	The current requirements make no provision for alerting users of failed bookings; it is up to the user to confirm that their booking was successful.
●	There should be a possibility to see the list of existing bookings for a particular date.
